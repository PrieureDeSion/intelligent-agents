## Intelligent Agents
### [WnCC Seasons of Code 2017](http://wncc-iitb.org/soc/)

This project is about exploring Reinforcement Learning and designing Artificially Intelligent Agents by employing algorithms and agents to traverse the virtual landscape of some games of our choice, in the OpenAI Universe Framework.

### Getting Started with OpenAI Universe

To get started, follow the installation instructions given [here](https://github.com/openai/universe/blob/master/README.rst#installation).

### Running a sample

To run the a simple _Hello World._ on Universe, you can use ```sample.py```. To run, launch a terminal and launch *Docker* as follows:

```s
sudo docker run -p 5900:5900 -p 15901:15901 --privileged --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --ipc host quay.io/openai/universe.flashgames:0.20.28

```

Then launch another terminal to run the game.  
```sh
sudo python main.py
```

__Now sit back and ENJOY!__

Hope you have a great time on the platform! Feel free to add suggestions and contributions with your own versions!
